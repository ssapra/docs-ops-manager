This topic describes the types of certificates used in <%= vars.platform_name %> that require
planned rotation.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

<%= vars.platform_name %> uses certificate authorities (CAs) and various leaf certificates.
CAs are self-signed certificates that issue leaf certificates. CAs can be custom or generated
by <%= vars.platform_name %>.

Leaf certificates are signed by a CA and are used to identify resources in <%= vars.platform_name %>.
Both root CAs and leaf certificates require planned rotation in <%= vars.platform_name %>.


## <a id='types'></a> Certificate Types

The following types of <%= vars.platform_name %> certificates require planned rotation:

* **<%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA:** The <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA issues other certificates
that <%= vars.platform_name %> uses. The root CA can be a <%= vars.platform_name %>-generated
CA or your own custom CA. The <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA expires four years after creation.
For more information about viewing the root CAs for <%= vars.ops_manager %>, see [Listing the
Root Certificate Authorities](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/opsman-api/#tag/Certificate-Authorities/paths/~1api~1v0~1certificate_authorities/get) in the <%= vars.ops_manager %>
API documentation.

* **Other internal CAs:** The following CAs are used primarily for internal purposes:
  * **BOSH NATS CA:** The BOSH NATS CA is rotated automatically when you rotate the <%= vars.ops_manager %>
  root CA.
  * **BOSH DNS CAs:** The BOSH DNS CAs are managed by CredHub and applied automatically.

* **Non-configurable certificates:** Non-configurable certificates are leaf certificates either
created by a CA stored in <%= vars.ops_manager %>, or created and stored by CredHub and managed
by <%= vars.ops_manager %> calls to the CredHub API. Non-configurable certificates are issued
directly by the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA, or by intermediate CAs in a chain of trust
originated by the root CA. Non-configurable certificates expire after two years. For more
information about about viewing non-configurable leaf certificates, see [Getting Information
About Certificates for Products](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/opsman-api/#tag/Certificates/paths/~1api~1v0~1deployed~1certificates/get) in the <%= vars.ops_manager %>
API documentation. For more information about generating non-configurable leaf certificates,
see [Generating New Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/opsman-api/#tag/Certificates/paths/~1api~1v0~1certificates~1generate/post) in the <%= vars.ops_manager %>
API documentation.

* **Configurable certificates:** Configurable certificates are leaf certificates supplied by
the user and pasted into configuration fields in <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Some configuration
panes include a **Generate RSA Certificate** button that supplies valid certificates, but users
can obtain configurable certificates from elsewhere. Configurable certificates generated by
<%= vars.ops_manager %> typically expire after two years. For more information about viewing
configurable leaf certificates, see [Getting Information About Certificates for Products]
(https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/opsman-api/#tag/Certificates/paths/~1api~1v0~1deployed~1certificates/get) in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API documentation.

* **Non-rotatable certificates:** Non-rotatable certificates are leaf certificates that, like
non-configurable certificates, are issued by the root CA. Unlike non-configurable certificates,
non-rotatable certificates cannot be rotated by the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API. For more
information about viewing non-rotatable leaf certificates, see [Getting Information About
Certificates for Products](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/opsman-api/#tag/Certificates/paths/~1api~1v0~1deployed~1certificates/get) in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API
documentation.

In addition to the types of certificates listed above, some <%= vars.platform_name %> products
issue their own tile certificates that are not managed by or visible to the <%= vars.ops_manager %>
API. These tile certificates do not require planned rotation because they rotate automatically
with product upgrades.

<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_full %>) and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %>
(<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) both use tile certificates in addition to their <%= vars.ops_manager %>
certificates.
