This topic describes how to check the expiration dates and types of the certificate authorities (CAs) and leaf certificates that the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API manages. After identifying the types of certificates that expire soon, you can determine which certificate rotation procedure to follow.


## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

You must use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API to manually check the expiration dates and types of the certificates that the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API manages. For more information, see [Procedure](#check-api) below.

To configure Concourse to automatically monitor expiring certificates, you can use Platform Automation. For more information, see [expiring-certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform-automation/v4.1/tasks.html#expiring-certificates) in the Platform Automation documentation.


## <a id='check-api'></a> Procedure

To check certificate expiration dates and types through the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API:

1. Follow the procedure in [Using <%= vars.ops_manager %> API](../../install/ops-man-api.html) to target and authenticate with the <%= vars.ops_manager %> User Account and Authentication (UAA) server. Record your <%= vars.ops_manager %> access token, and use it for `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` in the steps below.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you record your <%= vars.ops_manager %> access token, remove any newline characters such as <code>\n</code>.</p>

1. To retrieve the certificates, call the `/deployed/certificates` endpoint of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API by running:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is the `access_token` value you recorded in the previous step.
    <br>
    <br>
    More options:
      * To limit command output to certificates that expire within a given time interval, append `?expires_within=TIME` to the endpoint, replacing `TIME` with an integer-letter code.<br>
          * Valid letter codes are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months, and `y` for years. For example, querying to `https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=6m` searches for certificates expiring within six months.
      * To make the JSON output more readable, you can pipe your `curl` command to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or another text editor with JSON formatting.

1. The `deployed/certificates` output lists all CAs and leaf certificates visible to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API, whether they are stored in <%= vars.ops_manager %> directly or stored in CredHub. To determine the expiration date and type for each certificate listed:
  1. Determine the expiration date from the `valid_until` value. For example, the root CA listed below expires on August 12, 2020:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    {
          "configurable": true,
          "is\_ca": true,
          "property\_reference": ".properties.root\_ca.fb10484dd5541a273c9d",
          "property\_type": "rsa\_cert\_credentials",
          "product\_guid": "ops\_manager",
          "location": "ops\_manager",
          "variable\_path": null,
          "issuer": "/CN=ToolsmithsCA",
          "valid\_from": "2019-08-13T15:30:22Z",
          "valid\_until": "2020-08-12T15:30:22Z"
    }
    </pre>
  1. For any certificates expiring soon, use the following rules to identify their types:
      * **Non-rotatable certificates:** Non-rotatable certificates have the following property value:
          * `variable_path` matches `/p-bosh/service-instance_*/pxc_*`, `/p-bosh/service-instance_*/tls_certificate`, or `/p-bosh/service-instance_*/redis_certificate`
      * **Non-configurable certificates:** Non-configurable leaf certificates have the following property values:
          * `configurable` is `false`
          * `location` is either `ops_manager` or `credhub`
          * `is_ca` is `false`
      * **Configurable certificates:** Configurable leaf certificates have the following property values:
          * `configurable` is `true`
          * `is_ca` is `false`
      * **CAs:** CAs have the following property values:
          * `is_ca` is `true`
          * `location` is `ops_manager` or `credhub`

1. After you identify the list of certificates that expire soon, follow one of the procedures listed in [Overview of Certificate Rotation](api-cert-rotation.html).
