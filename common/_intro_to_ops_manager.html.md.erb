A <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment includes both your chosen runtime and the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard. The <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard is the dashboard for administering the runtimes and services within your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.

The BOSH Director, deployed as part of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation, controls VM creation and deployment,
as well as other software and service lifecycle events. <%= vars.ops_manager %> includes the BOSH Director tile used to configure BOSH Director.

Example runtimes and services managed though <%= vars.ops_manager %> include, but are not limited to, <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>).
