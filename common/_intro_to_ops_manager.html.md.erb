A <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment includes both your chosen runtime and Ops Manager. Ops Manager is the dashboard for administering the runtimes and services within your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.

The BOSH Director, deployed as part of the Ops Manager installation, controls VM creation and deployment,
as well as other software and service lifecycle events. Ops Manager includes the BOSH Director tile used to configure BOSH Director.

Example runtimes and services managed though Ops Manager include, but are not limited to, <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>).
