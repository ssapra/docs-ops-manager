    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The NTP server configuration only updates

    if you modify the value of this field.</p>


1. Leave the **JMX Provider IP Address** field blank.


1. Leave the **Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address** field blank.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Starting in PAS v2.0, BOSH-reported component
metrics are available in the Loggregator Firehose by default. If you continue to use
the BOSH HM Forwarder to consume these component metrics, you may receive duplicate data.
To prevent this, leave the <strong>Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address</strong> field blank.</p>



1. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** checkbox to enable the BOSH
Resurrector functionality and increase your runtime availability. <% if current_page.data.iaas == "vSphere" %>If you intend to install PAS,
  see [Using BOSH Resurrector and vSphere HA](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/resurrector.html) for more information about the Resurrector plugin.<% end %>



1. Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** to run a post-deploy script after deployment.
This script allows the job to execute additional commands against a deployment.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you intend to install PKS, you must enable post-deploy scripts.</p>


1. Select **Recreate all VMs** to force BOSH to recreate all VMs on the next deploy.
This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.


1. Select **Recreate All Persistent Disks** to force BOSH to migrate and recreate persistent
disks for the BOSH Director and all tiles. This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.


1. Select **Enable bosh deploy retries** to instruct Ops Manager to retry failed
BOSH operations up to five times.

1. Select **Keep Unreachable Director VMs** if you want to preserve BOSH Director VMs
after a failed deployment for troubleshooting purposes.

1. (Optional) Modify the **Director Workers** value,
  which sets the number of workers available to execute
  Director tasks. This field defaults to `5`.



1. (Optional) **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of
  threads that the BOSH Director can run simultaneously. Pivotal
  recommends that you leave the field blank to use the default
  value, unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.



1. (Optional) To add a custom URL for your BOSH Director,
  enter a valid hostname in **Director Hostname**. You can
  also use this field to configure a load balancer in front
  of your BOSH Director. For more information, see [How to Set Up a Load Balancer in Front of Operations Manager Director](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Set-Up-a-Load-Balancer-in-Front-of-Ops-Manager-Director) in Pivotal Support.<br/>
