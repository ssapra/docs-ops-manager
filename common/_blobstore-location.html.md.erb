Select a **Blobstore Location** to either configure the blobstore as an internal server or an external endpoint. Because the internal server is unscalable and less secure, Pivotal recommends that you configure an external blobstore.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After you deploy Ops Manager, you cannot change the blobstore location.</p>
  * **Internal**: Select this option to use an internal blobstore. Ops Manager creates a new VM for blob storage. No additional configuration is required.

  * **S3 Compatible Blobstore**: Select this option to use an external S3-compatible endpoint. When you have created an S3 bucket, complete the following steps:

   <br>![At the top of the image are the words 'Blobstore Location', with a selected radio button underneath labeled 'Internal'. Below this checkbox is a radio button labeled 'S3 Compatible Blobstore'. Below this radio button are four text fields labeled, from top to bottom, 'S3 Endpoint', 'Bucket Name', 'Access Key', and 'Secret Key'. The S3 Endpoint and Bucket Name fields have red asterisks, to denote that they are required fields when 'S3 Compatible Blobstore' is selected. The Access Key and Secret Key fields have red asterisks, to denote that they are required fields. Below the Secret Key field is a control group labeled 'S3 Signature Version.' The group contains two radio buttons labeled 'V2 Signature' and 'V4 Signature', and a text field labeled 'Region' with a red asterisk. Below the 'S3 Signature Version' group is another control group labeled 'S3 Backup Strategy with three radio button options: 'No Backups', 'Use a versioned bucket', and 'Copy into an additional bucket'. The additional bucket option has two text fields underneath, 'Backup Bucket Region' and 'Backup Button Name'.](../common/images/gcp/blobstore-s3.png)  
   Follow the procedures in [Sign up for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/SigningUpforS3.html) and [Creating a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) in the AWS documentation. When you have created an S3 bucket, complete the following steps:
      1. **S3 Endpoint**: Do one of the following:
          1. **If you are using a public S3 endpoint**:
              1. Locate the endpoint for your region. To find the endpoint, see the **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** table in [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) in the AWS documentation. 
              1. Construct a URL using your region's endpoint. For example, if you are using the `us-west-2` region, the URL you create would be <code>http<span>s://</span>s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com</code>. Enter this URL into the **S3 Endpoint** field.
          1. **If you are using a non-public S3 compatible enpoint**:
              1. Enter the URL for the non-public endpoint.
              1. Run `ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` to SSH into the Ops Manager VM. Replace `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` with the fully qualified domain name of Ops Manager.
              1. Copy the custom public CA certificate you used to sign the S3 endpoint into `/etc/ssl/certs` on the Ops Manager VM.
              1. On the Ops Manager VM, run `sudo update-ca-certificates -f -v` to import the custom CA certificate into the Ops Manager VM truststore.
              1. Add this custom CA certificate into the **Trusted Certificates** field in the **Security** page. See [Security Page](#security) for instructions.
      1. **Bucket Name**: Enter the name of the S3 bucket.
      1. **Access Key** and **Secret Key**: Enter the keys you generated when creating your S3 bucket.
      1. **Enable blobstore signed URLs**: Select this checkbox to configure BOSH VMs to generate short-lived, pre-signed URLs for communication between the BOSH Agent and blobstore. If you enable this feature, BOSH Agents do not use credentials to communicate with the blobstore, and VM disks do not store blobstore credentials.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This feature is experimental and only available for BOSH VMs that use Xenial stemcell line 621 or later.</p>
      1. Select **V2 Signature** or **V4 Signature**. If you select **V4 Signature**, enter your **Region**.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: AWS recommends using Signature Version 4. For more information about AWS S3 Signatures, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests</a> in the AWS documentation.</p>
      1. **S3 Backup Strategy**: Select one of the following to configure whether and how to back up the BOSH Director's S3 blobstore:
          - **No backups**
          - **Use a versioned bucket**: This option uses blobstore bucket versioning to save backups.  It requires an S3 blobstore that supports versioning.
          - **Copy into an additional bucket**: This option saves blobstore backups to a separate bucket, which is useful with blobstores that do not support versioning.  The option requires you to fill in **Backup Bucket Region** and **Backup Bucket Name**.
  * **GCS Blobstore**: Select this option to use an external Google Cloud Storage (GCS) endpoint.
  ![At the top of the image, the 'GCP Blobstore' radio button is selected. Below this radio button is a text field labeled 'Bucket Name' with a red asterisk. Below this text field is a dropdown labeled 'Storage Class' with a red asterisk and the 'Regional' option selected. Below this dropdown is a text area labeled 'Service Account Key' with a red asterisk.](../common/images/gcp/blobstore-gcp.png)  
  Follow the procedures in [Creating Storage Buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) in the GCS documentation to create a GCS bucket.

   When you have created a GCS bucket, complete the following steps:
        1. **Bucket Name**: Enter the name of your GCS bucket.
        1. **Storage Class**: Select the storage class for your GCS bucket. See [Storage Classes](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes) in the GCP documentation for more information.

        1. **Service Account Key**: Enter the contents of the JSON file that you downloaded in the [Set up IAM Service Accounts](../gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#iam_account) section of _Preparing to Deploy Ops Manager on GCP Manually_.

        1. **Service Account Key**: Follow the steps in the [Set up IAM Service Accounts](../gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#iam_account) section of _Preparing to Deploy Ops Manager on GCP Manually_ to download a JSON file with a private key. Enter the contents of the JSON file into the field.
