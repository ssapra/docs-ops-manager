Select a **Blobstore Location** to either configure the blobstore as an internal server or an external endpoint. Because the internal server is unscalable and less secure, Pivotal recommends that you configure an external blobstore.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After you deploy Ops Manager, you cannot change the blobstore location.</p>![Blobstore location options in the Director Config pane](../common/images/gcp/blobstore.png)
  * **Internal**: Select this option to use an internal blobstore. Ops Manager creates a new VM for blob storage. No additional configuration is required.
      * **Enable TLS**: Select this checkbox to enable TLS to the blobstore.
      <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using PASW 2016, make sure you have downloaded <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/stemcells/windows-stemcell-v1709x.html#1709.10">Windows stemcell v1709.10 or higher</a> before enabling TLS.</p>

   Follow the procedures in [Sign up for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/SigningUpforS3.html) and [Creating a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) in the AWS documentation. When you have created an S3 bucket, complete the following steps:
      1. **S3 Endpoint**: Do one of the following:
          1. **If you are using a public S3 endpoint**:
              1. Locate the endpoint for your region. To find the endpoint, see the **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** table in [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) in the AWS documentation. 
              1. Construct a URL using your region's endpoint. For example, if you are using the `us-west-2` region, the URL you create would be <code>http<span>s://</span>s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com</code>. Enter this URL into the **S3 Endpoint** field.
          1. **If you are using a non-public S3 compatible enpoint**:
              1. Enter the URL for the non-public endpoint.
              1. Run `ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` to SSH into the Ops Manager VM. Replace `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` with the fully qualified domain name of Ops Manager.
              1. Copy the custom public CA certificate you used to sign the S3 endpoint into `/etc/ssl/certs` on the Ops Manager VM.
              1. On the Ops Manager VM, run `sudo update-ca-certificates -f -v` to import the custom CA certificate into the Ops Manager VM truststore.
              1. Add this custom CA certificate into the **Trusted Certificates** field in the **Security** page. See [Security Page](#security) for instructions.
      1. **Bucket Name**: Enter the name of the S3 bucket.
      1. **Access Key** and **Secret Key**: Enter the keys you generated when creating your S3 bucket.
      1. Select **V2 Signature** or **V4 Signature**. If you select **V4 Signature**, enter your **Region**.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: AWS recommends using Signature Version 4. For more information about AWS S3 Signatures, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests</a> in the AWS documentation.</p>
