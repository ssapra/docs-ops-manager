<% current_page.data.title = "Upgrading " + vars.app_runtime_abbr + " and Other " + vars.platform_name + " Products" %>

This topic describes how to upgrade to a point release of <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>
(<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) and other product tiles without upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager_full %>.
For example, use this topic to upgrade from <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.0
to <%= vars.v_major_version %>.1. You might need to perform this upgrade if a security update
for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> is released, or if new features are introduced in a point
release of a product tile.

For <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> component and version information, see [<%= vars.app_runtime_full %>
<%= vars.v_major_version %> Release Notes](http://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/overview/release-notes/runtime-rn.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you cannot download products from <%= vars.product_network %>
  due to restricted network connectivity, see <a href="offline_installation.html">Installing
  <%= vars.platform_name %> in Air-Gapped Environments</a>.</p>


## <a id="before-upgrade"></a> Prerequisites

Before you upgrade to point releases:

* You must have completed the procedure in [Upgrading <%= vars.platform_name %>](upgrading-pcf.html).

* **Important:** Read the _Known Issues_ sections for the products that you plan to install
before starting. For all available product release notes, see:
  * [<%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/release-notes.html) in the <%= vars.ops_manager %>
  documentation
  * [<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/overview/release-notes/runtime-rn.html)
  in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> documentation
  * [<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/overview/release-notes/segment-rn.html)
  in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> documentation
  * [<%= vars.windows_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service-windows/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/release-notes.html)

  * [Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/release-notes.html) in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>
  documentation

## <a id="upgrade-er"></a> Upgrading <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using the <%= vars.product_network %> API, the latest
  product versions automatically appear in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.
  For more information, see <a href="add-delete.html#pivnet-api">Using <%= vars.product_network %> API
  to Upgrade Products</a> in <em>Adding and Deleting Products</em>.</p>

To upgrade <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> without upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>:

1. Download the product file from [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/).

1. Import the product file to your <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **+** icon next to the uploaded product description to add this product to your
staging area.

1. Click the newly added tile to review any configurable options.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes** to install the service.


## <a id="other-products"></a> Upgrading <%= vars.platform_name %> Products

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using the <%= vars.product_network %> API, the latest
  product versions automatically appear in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.
  For more information, see <a href="add-delete.html#pivnet-api">Using <%= vars.product_network %> API
  to Upgrade Products</a> in <em>Adding and Deleting Products</em>.</p>

This section describes how to upgrade individual products like [Single Sign-On for VMware Tanzu]
(https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/index.html), [MySQL for VMware Tanzu](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/index.html), [VMware RabbitMQ](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/index.html), and [App Metrics]
(https://docs.pivotal.io/app-metrics/index.html) in your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.
Ensure you review the individual product upgrade procedure for each tile.

To upgrade your products:

1. Browse to [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/) and sign in.

1. Download the latest release for the product or products that you want to upgrade. Every
product is tied to exactly one stemcell. Download the stemcell that matches your product and
version.

1. Browse to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> web interface and click **Import a Product**.

    <%= image_tag("import.png") %>

1. Select the `.pivotal` file that you downloaded from <%= vars.product_network %> or received
from your software distributor, then click **Open**. If the product is successfully added,
it appears in your product list. If the product that you selected is not the latest version,
the most up-to-date version will appear on your product list.

1. Click the **+** icon next to the product description to add the product tile to the
<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Repeat the import, upload, and upgrade steps for each product you downloaded.

1. If you are upgrading a product that uses a self-signed certificate from v1.1 to v1.2, you
must configure the product to trust the self-signed certificate. To configure a product to
trust the self-signed certificate:
    1. Click the product tile.
    1. In the left-hand column, select the setting page containing the SSL certificate configuration.
    For example, for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, select the **HAProxy** pane.
    1. Check the **Trust Self-Signed Certificates** box.
    1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.


## <a id="replica-tiles"></a> Upgrading Replicated Tiles

To upgrade a replicated tile, you must:

* Generate a replica of the newer version of the tile using the Replicator
* Give the new replica the same name as the existing replica.

### <a id="replica-example"></a> Example Workflow

This example workflow assumes the following:

* You used the Replicator to generate a replica of the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> v1
tile.
* You used the `name` **seg-one**.
* You installed the tile in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
* You used the following sample Replicator command for the initial installation:

    ```mac
    ./replicator-darwin\
    --name seg-one\
    --path /download/p-isolation-segment-v1.pivotal\
    --output /output/p-isolation-segment-v1-seg-one.pivotal
    ```

To upgrade your replicated tile to <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> v2:

1. Download and unzip the new Replicator from the [<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>]
(https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-isolation-segment/) page on <%= vars.product_network %>.
You must download the version of Replicator that corresponds with the version of the
<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile you want to replicate.

1. Create the replica by running:

    ```mac
      ./replicator-darwin\
      --name NAME-OF-EXISTING-REPLICA \
      --path PATH-TO-NEW-TILE \
      --output /output/p-isolation-segment-v2-seg-one.pivotal
    ```
    Where:
    * `NAME-OF-EXISTING-REPLICA` must be the same as the name used for the existing replica.
    In this example, this name is **seg-one**.
    * `PATH-TO-NEW-TILE` is the path to the new <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile.

1. After you create the replica tile **p-isolation-segment-v2-seg-one.pivotal**, upload it
to <%= vars.ops_manager %>. This upgrades the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> v1 replica tile
in place.
