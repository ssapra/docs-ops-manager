This topic describes how to deploy <%= vars.platform_name %> on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Before you deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %>, see the preparation steps in [Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP Manually](prepare-env-manual.html).

After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in [Configuring BOSH Director on GCP Manually](./config-manual.html).

## <a id='select-tgz'></a>Step 1: Locate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation File ##

1. Log in to the [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf), and click **<%= vars.ops_manager %>**.

1. From the **Releases** dropdown, select the release to install.

1. Select one of the following download files:
    * **<%= vars.ops_manager %> for GCP**
    * **<%= vars.ops_manager %> YAML for GCP**

    When you click the download link, your browser downloads or opens the <code>OpsManager_VERSION_onGCP.pdf</code> or <code>OpsManager_VERSION_onGCP.yml</code> file. <br/><br/>
   These documents provide the GCP location of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> `.tar.gz` installation file based on the geographic location of your installation.

1. Copy the filepath string of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> image based on your deployment location.

## <a id="create-image"></a>Step 2: Create a Private VM Image

1. Log in to the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

1. In the left navigation panel, click **Compute Engine**, and select **Images**.

1. Click **Create Image**.

1. Complete the following fields:
  * **Name**: Enter a name. For example, `om-pcf`.
  * **Encryption**: Leave **Automatic (recommended)** selected.
  * **Source**: Choose **Cloud Storage file**.
  * **Cloud Storage file**: Paste in the Google Cloud Storage filepath you copied from the PDF file in the [previous step](#select-tgz).

      <%= image_tag("../common/images/gcp/create_image.png", :alt => "Screenshot of the GCP Compute Engine console. The page is titled 'Create an image'. It shows an example of completed 'Create an image' fields.") %>

1. Click **Create**. The file might take a few minutes to import.

## <a id="start-vm"></a>Step 3: Create the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM Instance

1. Select the checkbox for the image that you created above.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/gcp/create_instance.png", :alt => "Screenshot of an example image. The page is titled 'Images'.") %>

1. Click **Create Instance**.

1. In the **Create an instance form**, complete the following fields:
  * **Name**: Enter a name that matches the naming conventions of your deployment.
  * **Zone**: Choose a zone from the region in which you created your network.
  * **Machine type**: Choose `n1-standard-2`.
    * Click **Customize** to manually configure the vCPU and memory. An <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance requires the following minimum specifications:

        | **Machine Spec** | **Minimum Value** |
        |------------------|----------------------|
        |CPU |2&nbsp;vCPUs |
        |Memory| 8&nbsp;GB |
  * **Boot disk**: Click **Change**, then perform the following steps:
     * Click **Custom images** if it is not already selected.
     * Select the **Boot disk type**. If your environment has high performance needs, select **SSD**. As an example, environments used to [develop <%= vars.platform_name %> tiles](http://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/) might benefit from a higher performing <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM boot disk. For most environments, you can select **Standard**.
     * Set the **Size (GB)** of the boot disk to the minimum or higher.

            | **Machine Spec** | **Minimum Value** |
            |------------------|----------------------|
            |Boot disk|100&nbsp;GB|
     * Select the <%= vars.ops_manager %> image you created in the previous step if it is not already selected.<br>
        <%= image_tag("../common/images/gcp/boot_image.png", :alt => "Screenshot of the VM instance dialog. The page is titled 'Boot disk'. It shows the example image selected.") %>
     * Click **Select** to save.
  * Under **Identity and API access**, select the **Service account** you created when preparing your environment during the step [Set up IAM Service Accounts](./prepare-env-manual.html#iam_account).
  * **Allow HTTP traffic**: Leave this checkbox unselected.
  * **Allow HTTPS traffic**: Leave this checkbox unselected.
  * **Networking**: Select the **Networking** tab, and perform the following steps:
     * Under **Network interfaces**, perform the following steps:
        * Remove the `default` network interface if this interface still exists.
        * Select the network you created when preparing your environment in [Create a GCP Network with Subnet](prepare-env-manual.html#create_network) in _Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP Manually. For example, `pcf-virt-net`.
        * Under **Subnetwork**, select the `pcf-infrastructure-subnet-GCP-REGION` subnet that you created when preparing your environment in [Create a GCP Network with Subnet](prepare-env-manual.html#create_network) in _Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP Manually.
        * For **Primary internal IP**, select **Ephemeral (Custom)**. Enter an IP address (for example, `192.168.101.5`) in the **Custom ephemeral IP address** field. Specify the next available internal IP address located within the reserved IP range that you [configure later in BOSH Director](./config-manual.html#network). Do not use the **Gateway IP**, for example `192.168.101.1`.
        * For **External IP**, select **Create IP address**. In the next form, enter a name for the static IP. For example, `om-public-ip`. Click **Reserve**. In the **External IP** dropdown, select the static IP address you just reserved.
     * For **Network tags**, enter `pcf-opsman` and `allow-https`. These tags apply the firewall rules you created in [Create Firewall Rules for the Network](prepare-env-manual.html#firewall_rules) to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.

1. Click **Create** to deploy the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM. This might take a few moments.

1. Navigate to your DNS provider, and create an entry that points a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) `opsman.MY-DOMAIN` to the `pcf-opsman` static IP address of <%= vars.ops_manager %> that you created in a previous step.
   <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In order to set up <%= vars.ops_manager %> authentication correctly, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends using an FQDN to access <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Using an ephemeral IP address to access <%= vars.ops_manager %> can cause authentication errors upon subsequent access.</p>

After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in [Configuring BOSH Director on GCP Manually](config-manual.html).

Later on, if you need to SSH into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM to perform diagnostic troubleshooting, see [Log In to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM Using SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh) in _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_.
