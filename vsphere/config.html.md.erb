## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisite

Before you begin this procedure, you must complete all steps in [Deploying Ops Manager to vSphere](./deploy.html).


## <a id="set-up"></a> Step 1: Set Up Ops Manager Authentication

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, Ops Manager maintains your user database.
    * [SAML Identity Provider](#saml): If you use a SAML Identity Provider (IdP), an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [LDAP Server](#ldap): If you use a LDAP Server, an external identity server maintains your user database.

### <a id='internal'></a> Internal Authentication

1.  When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create a user with administrative privileges.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/customizing/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) topic.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the username and password you created in the previous step.

1. Verify success.<br/><br/>

    You should be able to log in, and you should see the BOSH Director tile is present and ready for configuration, indicated by the orange color.

### <a id='saml'></a> SAML Identity Provider

<%= partial '../common/using_saml_idp_ops_manager' %>

### <a id='ldap'></a> LDAP Server

<%= partial '../common/using_ldap_server_ops_manager' %>


## <a id='vcenter-config'></a> Step 2: Configure vCenter

1. Click the **BOSH Director for vSphere** tile.

1. Select **vCenter Config**. Configure the one or more vCenters that host your <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation. The following image shows the top of the **vCenter Config** pane.
    <%= image_tag("../common/images/vcenter-config.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the header 'vCenter Config', across from which on the far right is a gray, rectangular button labeled 'Add vCenter Config'. Underneath these is a horizonal line. Below the line are text fields labeled, from top to bottom, 'Name', 'vCenter Host', 'vCenter Username', 'vCenter Password', and 'Datacenter Name'. All of these text fields have red asterisks, to denote that they are required fields. The Name field contains the text 'first-vcenter'. The vCenter Host field contains the text '10.87.41.6'. The vCenter Username field contains the text 'opsmgr@vsphere.local'. The vCenter Password field contains eight asterisks and has the word 'Change' underneath in blue letters to indicate that it is clickable. The Datacenter Name field contains the text 'six'. Below the Datacenter Name field is a dropdown labeled 'Virtual Disk Type', with a red asterisk and the 'thin' option selected. Below this dropdown is a text field labeled 'Ephemeral Datastore Names (comma delimited)', with a red asterisk and containing the text 'freenas-smurfs'. Below this field is the text 'NOTE: Removing an Ephemeral Datastore after an initial deploy can result in a system outage and/or data loss.' Below this text is another text field labeled 'Persistent Datastore Names (comma delimited)', with a red asterisk and containing the text 'freenas-smurfs'. Below this field is the text 'NOTE: Removing a Persistent Datastore after an initial deploy can result in a system outage and/or data loss.'") %>
1. Complete the following fields on the **vCenter Config** pane:
    * **Name**: A name that you provide for your vCenter configuration. This field is used to identify the datacenter configuration in Ops Manager if you are configuring multiple datacenters.
    * **vCenter Host**: The hostname of the vCenter that manages ESXi/vSphere.
    * **vCenter Username**: A vCenter username with create and delete privileges for virtual machines (VMs) and folders.
    * **vCenter Password**: The password for the vCenter user specified above.
    * **Datacenter Name**: The name of the datacenter as it appears in vCenter.
    * **Virtual Disk Type**: The Virtual Disk Type to provision for all VMs. For guidance on selecting a virtual disk type, see [vSphere Virtual Disk Types](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/customizing/disk-format.html).
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Datastores do not support whitespace characters in their names. Including whitespace characters in datastore names causes an error.</p>
    * **Ephemeral Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store ephemeral VM disks deployed by Ops Manager.
    * **Persistent Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store persistent VM disks deployed by Ops Manager.
1. To configure networking, complete the **vCenter Config** fields shown and described below:
    <%= image_tag("../common/images/vsphere/nsx-cert-auth.png", :alt => "At top are two radio buttons: labeled 'Standard vCenter Networking' and unselected, and labeled 'NSX Networking' and selected. Indented below are two radio buttons grouped under 'NSX Mode': 'NSX-V' and 'NSX-T' (selected). Below is text field labeled 'NSX Address' with 'nsxmgr-01.haas-200.pez.pivotal.io' filled in.  Below are two radio buttons grouped under 'NSX-T Authentication': 'Local User Authentication' and 'Certificate Authentication' (selected). Below are two text fields: 'NSX Username' with 'admin' filled in, and 'NSX Password' with hidden text. Below are two multiline text boxes: labeled 'NSX Manager Principal Identity Certificate' and 'NSX Manager Principal Identity Private Key'. Below and with extra space above is a multiline text box labeled 'NSX CA Cert' with an RSA certificate pasted in.") %>
    * **Standard vCenter Networking**: This is the default option when upgrading Ops Manager. If you select this option, you need not configure the **NSX Networking** fields below.
    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you intend to deploy <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> using Flannel as the CNI (as opposed to NSX-T), then select this option to configure the BOSH Director. Do not choose **NSX Networking**. When you configure the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile later on, you will configure Flannel as the container network interface (CNI). <br/><br/>If you intend to deploy <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> with NSX-T, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/vsphere-nsxt-index.html">Installing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center</a>.</p>
    * **NSX Networking**: Select this option to enable NSX network virtualization for non-<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> products such as <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>). This virtualization lets you configure component load balancing and security in the product tile [**Resource Config**](#resource-config) pane.
    Configure NSX networking by entering the following information:
        * **NSX Mode**: Select either **NSX-V** or **NSX-T**.
        * **NSX Address**: The address of the NSX Manager.
        * **NSX-T Authentication**: Select how BOSH Director authenticates to the NSX Manager:
            * **Local User Authentication** authenticates with a username and password.
                * For this option, fill in the **NSX Username** and **NSX Password** fields. Specify an NSX user with `Enterprise Administrator` privileges.
            * **Certificate Authentication** authenticates with a certificate and private key.
                * For this option, fill in the **NSX Manager Principal Identity Certificate** and **NSX Manager Principal Identity Certificate** fields.
        * **NSX CA Cert**: A CA certificate in PEM format that establishes a secure connection to the NSX server before the BOSH Director authenticates to the NSX Manager.
        If the NSX Manager generated a self-signed certificate, use the following command to retrieve the CA certificate using OpenSSL:

            ```
            openssl s_client -showcerts -connect NSX-MANAGER-ADDRESS:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509
            ```
            Where `NSX-MANAGER-ADDRESS` is the address of the NSX manager.

1. Configure the following folder names:
    * **VM Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder where Ops Manager places VMs. Enter `[YOUR-DEPLOYMENT]_vms` where `YOUR-DEPLOYMENT` corresponds to a descriptive name for your deployment. For example, `my_pcf_vms`.
    * **Template Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder where Ops Manager places templates. Enter `[YOUR-DEPLOYMENT]_templates`. For example, `my_pcf_templates`.
    * **Disk path Folder**: The vSphere datastore folder where Ops Manager creates attached disk images. You must not nest this folder. Enter `[YOUR-DEPLOYMENT]_disk`. For example, `my_pcf_disk`.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After initial deployment, you cannot edit folder names.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

1. (Optional) Click **Add vCenter Config** toward the top of the form to configure additional vCenters. Once you click **Save**, your multiple vCenter Configs are listed in the **vCenter Configs** pane. For more information about multiple vCenter configs, see [Managing Multiple Data Centers](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/customizing/multiple-datacenters.html).


## <a id='dir-config'></a> Step 3: Director Config Pane

<%= partial "../common/director-config" %>

## <a id='create-az'></a> Step 4: Create Availability Zones Pane

<%= vars.ops_manager %> Availability Zones (AZs) correspond to your vCenter clusters, resource pools or host groups.

Multiple AZs allow you to provide high availability and load balancing to your applications. When you run more than one instance of an application, Ops Manager balances those instances across all of the AZs assigned to the application.

Pivotal recommends that you use at least three AZs for a highly available installation of your chosen runtime.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For more information about AZs and high availability in vSphere, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/refarch/vsphere/vsphere_ref_arch.html#high-availability">Compute and HA Considerations</a> in <em>vSphere Reference Architecture</em>.</p>

1. Select **Create Availability Zones** to navigate to the pane.
    <%= image_tag("../common/images/create-az.png", :alt => "The 'Create Availability Zones' pane shows a list of two availability zones: 'first-az' and 'second-az' with a button to the right to 'Add'. The 'first-az' is expanded and shows the fields 'Name' and 'IaaS Configuration'. Below that, still in the expanded 'first-az', a subhead called 'Clusters' lists a group of two fields, 'Cluster' and 'Resource Pool' with a button to the right to 'Add Cluster'.") %>

1. Use the following steps to create the first AZ.
    * Click **Add**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the AZ.
    * Select a vCenter config name from the **IaaS Configuration** dropdown to associate your AZ with a vCenter. If you have only one vCenter config, or if you are creating your first AZ, IaaS Configuration defaults to the first vCenter and cannot be configured.
    * Enter the name of the vCenter **Cluster** where you deployed Ops Manager. You created this cluster in the [Prepare vSphere](./deploy.html#prepare-vsphere) step of _Deploying Ops Manager to vSphere_. For example, `Cluster1`.
    * Enter the name of the **Resource Pool** that you created in the [Prepare vSphere](./deploy.html#prepare-vsphere) step of _Deploying Ops Manager to vSphere_ to organize management components like Ops Manager and BOSH Director.
    For example, `RP-MGMT`. The jobs running in this AZ share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
    You only need to specify this resource group in one AZ.
    * (Optional) Enter the name of a **Host Group** for the AZ to use. The host group must be within the cluster you designated in the **Clusters** field. You created host groups in the [Prepare vSphere](./deploy.html#prepare-vsphere) step of _Deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> to vSphere_. For more information about using host groups, see [Host Groups in vSphere](host-groups.html).
    * (Optional) In the **VM-Host Affinity Rule** dropdown, select **SHOULD**.  Selecting **SHOULD** allows vSphere to restart VMs in another host group in the event of an AZ failure.
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The value for <strong>VM-Host Affinity Rule</strong> only applies if you are using Host Groups. If you do not specify a <strong>Host Group</strong> for the cluster, then any changes you make to <strong>VM-Host Affinity Rule</strong> are ignored.</p></p>
    * (Optional) Click **Add Cluster** to add more clusters to the AZ as required by your installation size and high availability requirements.

1. (Optional) Use the following steps to create additional AZs.
    * Click **Add**.
    * Specify **Cluster** and optionally, a **Resource Pool** or a **Host Group** with a **VM-Host Affinity Rule**. Typically you specify either a resource pool or a host group for an AZ, but not both.
    * Click **Add Cluster** to assign more clusters to the AZ as necessary for high availability. Click the trash icon to delete a cluster. The first cluster cannot be deleted.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='create-networks'></a> Step 5: Create Networks Pane

1. Select **Create Networks**.

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.

1. Depending on the runtime that you are deploying, do one of the following:
  * For <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, click **Add Network** and create the following networks:
      * `infrastructure`: This network is for Ops Manager and the BOSH Director.
      * `pas`: This network is for all the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> VMs including Gorouter, Diego cells, and Cloud Controller.
      * `services`: This network is for any service tiles to be deployed alongside <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.   <br/><br/>
    Use the values from the following table as a guide when you create each network, replacing the IP addresses with ranges that are available in your vSphere environment:

In the top right corner of the image is a blue, rectangular button labeled 'Save'. Below the header are four columns labeled, from left to right, 'Job', 'Instances', 'VM Type', and 'Persistent Disk Type'. Under 'Job' are rows labeled with the names of two VMs, 'BOSH Director' and 'Master Compilation Job'. The 'Master Compilation Job' row is expanded, which reveals two columns labeled, from left to right, 'NSX-T Configuration' and 'NSX-V Configuration'. In the 'NSX-T Configuration' column are three fields labeled, from top to bottom, 'NS Groups', 'VIF Type', and 'Logical Load Balancer'. The 'NS Groups' field contains the text 'group1, group2'. The 'VIF Type' field contains the text 'PARENT or null'. The 'Logical Load Balancer' field contains the text 'server pools' in JSON formatting. In the 'NSX-V Configuration' column are two fields labeled, from top to bottom, 'Security Groups' and 'Edge Load Balancers'. The 'Security Groups' field contains the text 'group1, group2'. The 'Edge Load Balancers' field contains a set of square brackets. Under 'Instances' are two dropdowns, with 'Automatic: 1' for BOSH Director and '1' for Master Compilation Job selected. Under 'VM Type' are two dropdowns, with 'Automatic: large.disk (cpu: 2, ram...' selected for BOSH Director and 'small (cpu: 1, ram: 2 GB, disk...' selected for Master Compilation Job. Under 'Persistent Disk Type' is one dropdown with 'Automatic: 50 GB' selected for BOSH Director and the word 'None' for Master Compilation Job.") %>

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **VM Type**, and **Persistent Disk Type** fields, choose **Automatic** from the dropdown to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For the BOSH Director job, select a VM type with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you install <%= vars.windows_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>), provision your <strong>Master Compilation Job</strong> with at least 100&nbsp;GB of disk space.</p>

1. (Optional) If you are using NSX-T or NSX-V networking, as specified on the [**vCenter Config**](#vcenter-config) pane,
and you want to configure security and load balancing for the BOSH Director job:
  1. Select the icon next to the **BOSH Director** job name to reveal the **NSX-T Configuration** and **NSX-V Configuration** columns.
  2. Enter your NSX-T or NSX-V configuration values in these fields.

1. Click **Save**.
