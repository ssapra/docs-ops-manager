title: Configuring BOSH Director on OpenStack
owner: Ops Manager
iaas: OpenStack
---

This topic describes how to configure BOSH Director after deploying [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on OpenStack. Use this topic when [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on OpenStack](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/openstack.html).

* Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all steps in [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./setup.html).

* After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in [Configuring PAS](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/configure-pas.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a>.</p>


## <a id='log-in'></a> Step 1: Access Ops Manager

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain you created in the [Create a DNS Entry](./setup.html#dns-entry) step of _Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure_.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, Ops Manager maintains your user database.
    * [SAML Identity Provider](#saml): If you use a SAML Identity Provider (IdP), an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [LDAP Server](#ldap): If you use a LDAP Server, an external identity server maintains your user database.

### <a id='internal'></a> Internal Authentication

1.  When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, do the following:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) topic.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created in the previous step.

### <a id='ldap'></a> LDAP Server

<%= partial '../common/using_ldap_server_ops_manager' %>


## <a id='openstack-config'></a> Step 2: OpenStack Configs Page

1. In the left navigation of your OpenStack dashboard, click **Project > Compute > Access & Security**. Select the **API Access** tab.

1. Record the **Service Endpoint** for the **Identity** service. You use this Service Endpoint as the Authentication URL for Ops Manager in a later step.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/openstack/record-endpoint.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the header 'Access & Security'. Below this header are four tabs labeled, from left to right, 'Security Groups', 'Key Pairs', 'Floating IPs', and 'API Access'. API Access is selected. Below the API Access tab are four rectangular buttons labeled, from left to right, 'Download OpenStack RC File v2.0', 'Download OpenStack RC File v3', 'Download EC2 Credentials', and 'View Credentials'. Below these buttons are two columns labeled 'Service' and 'Service Endpoint'. Under the Service column are thirteen rows labeled, from top to bottom, 'Network', 'S3', 'Cloudformation', 'Object Store', 'Artifact', 'Compute_Legacy', 'Volumev3', 'Compute', 'Image', 'Volumev2', 'Identity', 'Volume', and 'Orchestration'.

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable. Review the [Configure Security](setup.html#security) step of _Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to OpenStack_ to ensure you have configured ICMP in your Security Group.

1. Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks using information from your OpenStack network:
    * Click **Add Network**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
    * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network.
    * For **Network ID**, use the **ID** from the OpenStack page.
    * For **CIDR**, use the **Network Address** from the OpenStack page.
    * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, use the first 10 IP addresses of the **Network Address** range, and the private IP address of the Ops Manager instance that you recorded in the [Associate a Floating IP Address](./setup.html#floating-ip) step of _Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure_.
    * For **DNS**, enter one or more Domain Name Servers.
    * For **Gateway**, use the **Gateway IP** from the OpenStack page.
    * For **Availability Zones**, select which Availability Zones to use with the network.
